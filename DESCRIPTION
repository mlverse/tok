Title: Fast Text Tokenization
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Authors@R: c(
    person("Daniel", "Falbel", , "daniel@posit.co", c("aut", "cre")),
    person(family = "Posit", role = c("cph"))
  )
Description:
  Interfaces with the 'Hugging Face' tokenizers library to provide implementations
  of today's most used tokenizers such as the 'Byte-Pair Encoding' algorithm 
  <https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/index>. It's extremely fast for both 
  training new vocabularies and tokenizing texts.
